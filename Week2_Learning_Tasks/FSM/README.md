A finite state machine (FSM), also known as a finite state automaton, is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of a system that can be in a finite number of states. It consists of a set of states, a set of input symbols or events, a set of transitions between states based on the input, and a set of outputs or actions associated with each state.

Let's break down the components of a finite state machine:

States: States represent different conditions or configurations that the system can be in at any given time. Each state is typically represented by a node or circle in a diagram. For example, in a vending machine, the states can be "Idle," "Selection Made," "Payment Processing," and "Item Dispensed."

Transitions: Transitions define the movement from one state to another based on the input or event received by the system. They are represented by directed arrows between the states in the diagram. Transitions are triggered by specific input symbols or events and can cause a change in the current state. For instance, in the vending machine example, the transition from "Idle" to "Selection Made" might be triggered when a user presses a button to select a product.

Input symbols or events: These are the signals or events that trigger state transitions. They can include user inputs, sensor readings, timers, or any other external or internal events that affect the system. In the vending machine example, the input symbols can be the user pressing buttons, inserting coins, or pressing the start button.

Outputs or actions: Outputs are the actions or behaviors associated with each state. They define what the system does when it enters a particular state. Outputs can include displaying messages, performing calculations, activating devices, or any other actions relevant to the system's behavior. In the vending machine example, the outputs can be displaying the selected item, deducting the appropriate amount from the payment, and dispensing the product.

Finite state machines can be represented using state transition diagrams or state transition tables. State transition diagrams visually represent the states, transitions, and outputs using nodes, arrows, and labels. State transition tables list the current states, input symbols, next states, and associated outputs in a tabular format.

FSMs are widely used in various domains, including software engineering, hardware design, robotics, control systems, and protocol specification. They provide a clear and structured way to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems with a finite number of states.

By defining the states, transitions, and outputs of a system using an FSM, it becomes easier to understand, design, and implement the desired behavior and logic of the system.


There are several types of finite state machines (FSMs) that are commonly used to model and describe different types of systems. The main types of FSMs include:
Mealy Machine: In a Mealy machine, the outputs or actions associated with each state are dependent on both the current state and the input symbol. The outputs are produced during the state transitions. Therefore, the outputs of a Mealy machine are a function of the current state and the input. Mealy machines are often used when the outputs are directly related to the inputs and transitions.

Moore Machine: In a Moore machine, the outputs or actions associated with each state are dependent only on the current state. The outputs are associated with the states themselves, and they remain constant throughout the state. Therefore, the outputs of a Moore machine are solely determined by the current state and are independent of the input symbols.
