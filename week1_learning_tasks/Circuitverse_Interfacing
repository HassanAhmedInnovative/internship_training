 It is an open-source platform for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
 It offers a user-friendly interface and a wide range of components to facilitate circuit design.
 
 
 Accessing CircuitVerse:
It can be accessed by visiting the website (https://circuitverse.org/). 
It is a web-based tool, hence no need to install any software.


Circuit Design:
 Users can drag and drop components from the library onto the canvas and connect them using wires.
 CircuitVerse supports a variety of logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and other components necessary for digital logic design.
 
 
 Simulation:
 CircuitVerse provides a simulation feature that allows users to test their circuits' behavior. 
 Users can input values to the circuit and observe the outputs.
 CircuitVerse offers both basic simulations and advanced timing analysis.
 

Waveform Behaviour:
we have the availability of the waveform viewer in CircuitVerse as well.
This waveform viewer allows users to visualize the circuit's behavior over time.
Users can also add probes to specific nodes in the circuit and view the corresponding waveforms.


Collaborative Features:
It has collaborative features, such as the ability to share circuits with others and work together on projects.
Users can generate shareable links to their circuits or collaborate with team members in real-time.


Exporting And Embedding:
Users can export their circuits from CircuitVerse in various formats, such as images or netlists, for use in other tools or documentation. Additionally
CircuitVerse provides an option to embed circuits directly into websites or online platforms.


Learning Resources:
There are several learning resources provided by CircuitVerse, such as tutorials, documentation, or examples.
Users are encouraged  to explore these resources to enhance their understanding of digital logic design and circuit simulation.


Conclusion:
Users are advised  to leverage CircuitVerse's features for their circuit design projects, simulations, and collaborative work.
